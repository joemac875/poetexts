                    <l>Place its toothpicked pit in water, watch the grist</l>
                    <l>of its insides grow. Witness its opopulous bloom,</l> 
                    <l>honeycombed with rough. Its cobblestones grip</l>
                    <l>the heart in its mitt, a closed fist thickened</l>
                    <l>and gritty as silt. The swamp of the plumb beat</l>
                    <l>adamant as weeds. The dish of which is salted-</l>
                    <l>by complexities or cries. It is a house in which</l>
                    <l>we cannot live, the quiver on the arrow</l>
                    <l>we cannot launch. It grows late over Nevada</l>
                    <l>as we watch. Strikes its gullies: we grow burnt</l>
                    <l>as a moth. Mimics a sleep of archives and</l>
                    <l>the small lies all forget. Mimics all laughter</l>
                    <l>broken by the time it lwaves the mouth.</l>
                    <l>With its moving parts, its chimes, its gleam</l>
                    <l>it muddies our archways, lying low, gives off</l>
                    <l>noise and steam; its mechanics clear the fence.</l>
                    <l>It must be wooed. Must be quieted. Hush. It must</l>
                    <l>be soothed. Has a snag. Has a bleed. A drape.</l>
                    <l>Flaps awkwardly, at its edge, a heron. At</l>
                    <l>its center, a wide bottom perfect with fish.</l>
