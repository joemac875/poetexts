                    <l>These are my two drops of rain</l>
                    <l> Waiting on the window-pane.</l>
                    
                    <l>I am waiting here to see</l>
                    <l>Which the winning one will be.</l> 
                    
                    <l>Both of them have different names.</l>
                    <l>One is John and one is James.</l>
                    
                    <l>All the best and all the worst</l>
                    <l>Comes from which of them is first.</l>
                    
                    <l>James has just begun to ooze.</l>
                    <l>He's the one I want to lose.</l>
                    
                    <l>John is waiting to begin.</l>
                    <l>He's the one I want to win.</l>
                    
                    <l>James is going slowly on.</l>
                    Something sort of sticks to John.</l>
                    
                    <l>John is moving off at last.</l>
                    <l>James is going pretty fast.</l>
                    
                    <l>John is rushing down the pane.</l>
                    <l>James is going slow again.</l>
                    
                    <l>James has met a sort of smear.</l>
                    John is getting very near.</l>
                    
                    <l>Is he going fast enough?</l>
                    <l>(James has found a piece of fluff.)</l>
                    
                    <l>John has quickly hurried by.</l>
                    <l>(James was talking to a fly.)</l>
                    
                    <l>John is there, and John has won!</l>
                    <l>Look! I told you! Here's the sun!</l>
