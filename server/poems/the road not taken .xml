          <l>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</l>
          <l>And sorry I could not travel both,</l> 
          <l>And be one traveler, long I stood</l>
          <l>And looked down one as far as I could</l>
          <l>To where it bent in the undergrowth;</l>
          <l>Then took the other, as just as fair,</l>
          <l>And having perhaps the better claim,</l>
          <l>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;</l>
          <l>Though as for that the passing there</l>
          <l>Had worn them really about the same,</l>
          <l>And both that morning equally lay</l>
          <l>In leaves no step had trodden black.</l>
          <l>Oh, I kept the first for another day!</l>
          <l>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,</l>
          <l>I doubted if I should ever come back.</l>
          <l>I shall be telling this with a sigh</l>
          <l>Somewhere ages and ages hence:</l>
          <l>Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”</l>
          <l>I took the one less traveled by,</l>
          <l>And that has made all the difference.</l>
