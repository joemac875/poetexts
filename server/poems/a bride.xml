               <l>'O I am weary!' she sighed, as her billowy</l>
               <l>Hair she unloosed in a torrent of gold</l> 
               <l>That rippled and fell o'er a figure as willowy,</l>
               <l>Graceful and fair as a goddess of old:</l>
               <l>Over her jewels she flung herself drearily,</l>
               <l>Crumpled the laces that snowed on her breast,</l>
               <l>Crushed with her fingers the lily that wearily</l>
               <l>Clung in her hair like a dove in its nest--.</l>
               <l>And naught but her shadowy form in the mirror</l>
               <l>To kneel in dumb agony down and weep near her!</l>
               <l>'Weary--?' Of what? Could we fathom the mystery--?</l>
               <l>Lift up the lashes weighed down by her tears</l>
               <l>And wash with their dews one white face from her history,</l>
               <l>Set like a gem in the red rust of years?</l>
               <l>Nothing will rest her-- unless he who died of her</l>
               <l>Strayed from his grave, and in place of the groom,</l>  
               <l>Tipping her face, kneeling there by the side of her,</l>  
               <l>Drained the old kiss to the dregs of his doom--.</l>  
               <l>And naught but that shadowy form in the mirror</l>  
               <l>To heel in dumb agony down and weep near her!</l>
