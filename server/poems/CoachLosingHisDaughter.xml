               <l>He stares at his players</l>
               <l>who turn him into aging wood,</l>
               <l>make him sexless as his little finger.</l>
               <l>When he tries to talk to her,</l>
               <l>his sentences dissolve, the nouns</l>
               <l>and verbs all floating mute</l>
               <l>into the sky’s blue ear.</l> 
               <l>He knows why his players</l> 
               <l>lift and curl. He sees them</l> 
               <l>tightening their belts. Bodies</l> 
               <l>that well built should build</l> 
               <l>a house, knock a bully</l> 
               <l>on his can.  But after practice,</l> 
               <l>Coach can only see his daughter</l> 
               <l>getting in their cars, feel</l> 
               <l>their muscles sweating on her skin.</l>
