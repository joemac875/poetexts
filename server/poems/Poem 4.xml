              <l>I am going to die.</l>
          <l>No such thought has ever occured to me</l> 
          <l>since the beginning of my exclusive time</l>
          <l>in air, when God, having made my mind,</l>
          <l>first began to wrap it, sllowly and continuously,</l>
          <l>in strips of linen soaked in a special admixture</l>
          <l>or rosewater, chicken fat, and pinecones</l>
          <l>studded with cloves to stop them from dripping.</l>
          <l>Nor is it likely I would ever have had such a thought</l>
          <l>in the time required by Him to finish the job,</l>
          <l>if someone else had not first introduced the thought</l>
          <l>into the process, thereby interrupting it,</l>
          <l>however briefly. But who?</l>
