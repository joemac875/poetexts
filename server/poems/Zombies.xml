               <l>We began the journey in Morg city</l>
               <l>Hopefully you enjoy this little ditty</l> 
               <l>treyarch announced that there'd be a new crew</l>
               <l>some folks liked that it was new, others gave it a massive boo</l>
               <l>that crew consisted of a dancer , a boxer ,a magician and a cop</l>
               <l>Overall this made people run to their game shop.</l>
               <l>These 4 heros knew they had to defend their city from dusk to dawn</l>
               <l>From the evil squid army known as the apothicons</l>
               <l>but no one was aware that the mad doc was being a creeper</l>
               <l>The shadowman was stuck inside the key</l>
               <l>and it looked like our 4 were free.</l>
               <l>But the mad Doc was having non of that</l>
               <l>So he stole the key from them and took off just like that</l>
               <l>The mad doc teleported to his facility</l>
               <l>Where he met his twin brother , and with such agility</l>
               <l>He put his twin down</l>
               <l>His 3 friends asked him to explain why</l>
               <l>But the Doc just smiled at them and said "Vat I do I do only to secure a better tomorrow"</l>
               <l>then proceded to say , next ve will go somewhere vere der is snow.</l>
