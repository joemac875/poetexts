              <l>imagine your heart is just a ball you learned to dribble up</l>
          <l>and down the length of your driveway back home. slow down</l> 
          <l>control it. plant your feet in the soft blue of your mat and</l>
          <l>release</l>
          <l>it is hard but slowly you are unlearning the shallow plant</l>
          <l>of your childhood. extend your body-do not reach</l>
          <l>for someone but something fixed and fleshless and certain-</l>
          <l>fold flatten then lift your head like a cobra sure of the sun</l>
          <l>waiting and ready to caress the chill</l>
          <l>from its scales. inhale-try not to remeber how desperate</l>
          <l>you've been for touch-yes ignore it-that hitch of your heart</l>
          <l>you got from mornings you wke to find momma hysterical</l>
          <l>or gone. try to give up the certainty she'd never return</l>
          <l>recall only the return and not its coldness. imagine her arms</l>       
          <l>wide to recieve you imagine you are not a thing that needs</l>    
          <l>escaping. it is hard and though at times you are sure</l> 
          <l>you will always be the abandoned girl trying to abandon herself</l>     
          <l>push up arch deep into your back exhale and remeber-</l>   
          <l>when it is too late to pray the end of the flood</l>     
          <l>we pray instead to survive it.</l>
