              <l>It was a house that suffered most. </l>
          <l>It had begun with slamming doors, angry feet scuffing the carpets,</l> 
          <l>dishes slammed into the table,</l>
          <l>greasy stains spreading on the cloth.</l>
          <l>Certian doors were locked at night,</l>
          <l>feet stood for hours outside them,</l>
          <l>dishes were left unwashed, the cloth</l>
          <l>disappeared under a hardened crust.</l>
          <l>The house came to miss the shouting voices,</l>
          <l>the threats, the half-apologies, noisy </l>
          <l>reconciliations, the sobbing that followed.</l>
          <l>Then lines were drawn, borders established,</l>
          <l>some rooms declared their loyalties,</l>
          <l>Keeping to themselves, keeping out the other.</l>     
          <l>The house divided against themselves</l>    
          <l>Seeing cracking paint, broken windows,</l>    
          <l>the front door banging in the wind</l>     
          <l>the roof tiles flying off, one by one,</l>    
          <l>the neighbors said it was a madhouse</l>    
          <l>It was the house that suffered the most.</l>
