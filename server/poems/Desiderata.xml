               <l>Go placidly amid the noise and haste,</l>
             <l>and remember what peace there may be in silence.</l>
             <l>As far as possible without surrender</l>
             <l>be on good terms with all persons.</l>
          <l/>
             <l>Speak your truth quietly and clearly;</l>
             <l>and listen to others,</l>
             <l>even the dull and the ignorant;</l>
             <l>they too have their story. </l>
          <l/>
               
             <l>Avoid loud and aggressive persons,</l>
             <l>they are vexations to the spirit.</l>
             <l>If you compare yourself with others,</l>
             <l> you may become vain and bitter;</l>
             <l>for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.</l>
          <l/>
             <l> Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans </l>
               
               <l>Keep interested in your own career, however humble;</l>
               <l>it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.</l>
               <l>Exercise caution in your business affairs;</l>
               <l>for the world is full of trickery.</l>
          <l/>
               <l>But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;</l>
               <l>many persons strive for high ideals;</l>
               <l>and everywhere life is full of heroism.</l>
          <l/> 
               
               <l>Be yourself.</l>
               <l>Especially, do not feign affection.</l>
               <l>Neither be cynical about love;</l>
               <l>for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment</l>
               <l>it is as perennial as the grass. </l>
          <l/>
               
               <l> Take kindly the counsel of the years,</l>
               <l>gracefully surrendering the things of youth.</l>
               <l> Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.</l>
               <l> But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.</l>
               <l> Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.</l>
               <l> Beyond a wholesome discipline,</l>
               <l>be gentle with yourself. </l>
          <l/>
               
               <l>You are a child of the universe,</l>
               <l>no less than the trees and the stars;</l>
               <l>you have a right to be here.</l>
               <l>And whether or not it is clear to you,</l>
               <l>no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. </l>
          <l/>
               
               <l>Therefore be at peace with God,</l>
               <l>whatever you conceive Him to be,</l>
               <l> and whatever your labors and aspirations,</l>
               <l>in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.</l>
          <l/> 
               
               <l> With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,</l>
               <l>it is still a beautiful world.</l>
               <l>Be cheerful.</l>
          <l/>
               <l>Strive to be happy.</l>
