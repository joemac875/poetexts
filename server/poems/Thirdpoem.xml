          <l>was what he needed and a minute before the two</l> 
          <l>brown poodles walked by he looked the stripped-down trees</l>
          <l>from one more point of view and thought they were</l>
          <l>part of a system in which the dappled was foreign</l>
          <l>for he had arrived at his own conclusion and that was</l>
          <l>for him a relief even if he was seperated</l>
          <l>even if his hands were frozen</l>
          <l>even if the wind knocked him down</l>
          <l>even if his cat went into her helpless mode</l>
