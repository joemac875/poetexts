                    <l>Maybe humans are the failed A.I. of Nature.</l>
                    <l>Maybe Nature made something it thought would tend the garden.</l> 
                    <l>Maybe Nature made something sexy, to watch</l>
                    <l>clean the pools with long butterfly nets</l>
                    <l>and a sunburn—the retainers of Nature.</l>
                    <l>Now, mirror of mercury and Hell, that hot-red bomb</l>
                    <l>in your mouth, that sweet battleground on your tongue—</l>
                    <l>it is the catastrophe of your mission.</l>
                    <l>The wealthy, with their outstanding educations</l>
                    <l>and custom shoes, and empty apartments</l>
                    <l>floating above like Glinda; the ballad of media,</l>
                    <l>the intellectuals, almost shepherding</l>
                    <l>evolution, falling asleep in their haunted paintings</l>
                    <l>and unattainable poetry—all the dimensions</l>
                    <l>of each person’s being, punk, restless in a loop.</l>
                    <l>Sometimes I want to be taken into nothingness.</l>
                    <l>I want to be burned with the gypsy moths and bindweed.</l>
                    <l>Run to exhaustion with the wildebeest.</l>
                    <l>I don’t want this phone, I want to kill God.</l>
                    <l>Maybe humans are the complex systems</l>
                    <l>of a natural order that must build and destroy itself in perpetuity.</l>
                    <l>Blue chicory on the road saying the end of summer</l>
                    <l>in a sandstorm of our passing—they gyrate and smile—</l>
                    <l>what of our little duties to the architect?</l>
                    <l>Our deep-red blood, our lush tech—</l>
                    <l>Archangels, limping in paradise.</l>
