               <l>When he got to the farmhouse, he rifled through</l>
               <l>the cabinets, drawers, and cupboards,</l> 
               <l>and his buddies did too. The place was abandoned,</l>
               <l>or so he thought, and his buddies did too.</l>
               <l>He tried to talk to people in town, and his buddies did too,</l>
               <l>but he was the only one whose Yiddish made it</l>
               <l>across into German. They took his meaning.</l>
               <l>He, in the farmhouse, took a camera and a gun,</l>
               <l>but his buddies, who knows. About the gun,</l>
               <l>itâ€™s also hard to say, but after the war he took up</l>
               <l>photography, why not, and shot beautiful women</l>
               <l>for years. Got pretty good at it, and how.</l>
               <l>Won prizes and engraved plates, put them in a drawer, forgot</l>
               <l>the war, forgot his buddies, forgot the women, forgot the drawer.</l>
