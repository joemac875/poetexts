              <l>Traveling through the dark I found a deer</l>
          <l>dead on the edge of the Wilson River road.</l> 
          <l>It is usually best to roll them into the canyon:</l>
          <l>that road is narrow; to swerve might make more dead.</l>
               
          <l>By glow of the tail-light I stumbled back of the car</l>
          <l>and stood by the heap, a doe, a recent killing;</l>
          <l>she had stiffened already, almost cold.</l>
          <l>I dragged her off; she was large in the belly.</l>
               
          <l>My fingers touching her side brought me the reason-</l>
          <l>her side was warm; her fawn lay there waiting,</l>
          <l>alive, still, never to be born.</l>
          <l>Beside that mountain road I hesitated.</l>
               
          <l>The car aimed ahead its lowered parking lights;</l>
          <l>under the hood purred the steady engine.</l>
          <l>I stood in the glare of the warm exhaust turning red;</l>
               <l>around our group I could hear the wilderness listen.</l>
               
               <l>I thought hard for us all- my only swerving-,</l>
               <l>then pushed her over the edge into the river.</l>
