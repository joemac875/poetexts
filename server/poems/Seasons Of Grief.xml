                    <l>Shall I wither and fall like and autumn leaf,</l>
                    <l>From this deep sorrow- from this painful grief?</l> 
                    <l>How can I go on or find a way to be strong?</l>
                    <l>Will I ever again enjoy life's sweet song?</l>
                    <l>Sometimes a warm memory sheds light in the dark</l>
                    <l>And eases the pain like the song of a Meadow Lark.</l>
                    <l>Then it flits aqay on silent wings and I'm alone;</l>
                    <l>Hungering for more of the light it had shone.</l>
                    <l>Shall grief's bitter cold sadness consume me,</l>
                    <l>Like a winter storm on the vast angry sea?</l>
                    <l>How can I fill the void and deep desperate need</l>
                    <l>To replant my heart with hope's lovely seed?</l>
                    <l>Then I look at a photo of your playful smiling face</l>
                    <l>And for a moment I escape to a serene happy place;</l>
                    <l>Remembering the laughter and all you would do,</l>
                    <l>Cherishing the honest, caring, loving spirit of you.</l>
                    <l>Shall spring's cheerful flowers bring life anew</l>
                    <l>And allow me to forget the agony of missing you>?</l>
                    <l>Will spring's burst of new life bring fresh hope</l>
                    <l>And teach mhy grieving soul how to cope?</l>
                    <l>Sometimes I'll read a treasured card you had given me</l>
                    <l>And each word's special meaning makes me see,</l>
                    <l>The precious gift of love I was fortunate to receive,</l>
                    <l>And I realize you'd never want to see me grieve.</l>
                    <l>Shall summer's warm brilliant sun bring new light,</l>
                    <l>ANd free my anguished mind of its terrible plight?</l>
                    <l>Will its gentle breezes chase grief's dark clouds away,</l>
                    <l>And show me a clear path towards a better day?</l>
                    <l>When I visit the grave where you lie in eternal peace,</l>
                    <l>I know that death and heaven brough you release;</l>
                    <l>I try to envision your joy on that shore across the sea,</l>
                    <l>And, until I join you, that'll have to be enough for me.</l>
                    <l>For all the remaining seasons of m life on earth,</l>
                    <l>There'll be days I'll miss your merriment and mirth,</l>
                    <l>And sometimes I'll sadly loong for all the yesterdays;</l>
                    <l>Missing our chats and your gentle understanding ways.</l>
                    <l>Yet, the lessons of kindness and love you taught me,</l>
                    <l>And the good things in life you've helped me to see;</l>
                    <l>Linger as lasting gifts that comfort and will sustain,</l>
                    <l>Until I journey to that peaceful shore and see you again.</l>
