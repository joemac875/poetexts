               <l>Every night, we couldn’t sleep.</l>
               <l>Our upstairs neighbors had to keep</l>
               <l>Dropping something down the hall—</l>
               <l>A barbell or a bowling ball,</l>
          
               <l>And from the window by the bed,</l> 
               <l>Echoing inside my head,</l>
               <l>Alley cats expended breath</l>
               <l>In arias of love and death. </l>
          
               <l>Dawn again, across the street,</l>
               <l>Jackhammers began to beat </l>  
               <l>Like hangovers, and you would frown— </l>
               <l>That well-built house, why tear it down? </l>
          
               <l>Noon, the radiator grill</l>
               <l>Groaned, gave off a lesser chill</l> 
               <l>So that we could take off our coats.</l>
               <l>The pipes coughed to clear their throats.</l>
               
               <l>Our nerves were frayed like ravelled sleeves, </l>
               <l>We cherished each our minor griefs </l>  
               <l>To keep them warm until the night, </l> 
               <l>When it was time again to fight;</l> 
          
               <l>But we were young, did not need much </l>
               <l>To make us laugh instead, and touch,</l>
               <l>And could not hear ourselves above </l>
               <l>The arias of death and love.</l>
