                    <l>When death comes</l>
                    <l>like the hungry bear in autumn;</l> 
                    <l>when death comes and takes all the bright coins from his purse</l>
                    <l></l>
                    <l>to buy me, and snaps the purse shut;</l>
                    <l>when death comes</l>
                    <l>like the measle-pox</l>
                    <l></l>
                    <l>when death comes</l>
                    <l>like an iceberg between the shoulder blades,</l>
                    <l></l>
                    <l>I want to step through the door full of curiosity, wondering:</l>
                    <l>what is it going to be like, that cottage of darkness?</l>
                    <l></l>
                    <l>And therefor I look upon everything</l>
                    <l>as a brotherhood and a sisterhood,</l>
                    <l>and I look upon time as no more than an idea,</l>
                    <l>and I consider eternity as another possibility,</l>
                    <l></l>
                    <l>and I think of each like as a flower, as common</l>
                    <l>as a field daisy, and as singular,</l>
                    <l></l>
                    <l>and each body a lion of courage, and something</l>
                    <l>precious to the earth.</l>
                    <l></l>
                    <l>When it's over, I want to say all my life</l>
                    <l>I was a bride married to amazement.</l>
                    <l>I was the bridegroom, taking the world into my arms.</l>
                    <l></l>
                    <l>When it's over, I don't want to wonder</l>
                    <l>if I have made of my life something particular, and real.</l>
                    <l></l>
                    <l>I don't want to find myself sighing and frightened,</l>
                    <l>or full of argument.</l>
                    <l></l>
                    <l>I don't want to end up simply having visited this world.</l>
