                    <l> Most every night when they're in bed,</l>
                    <l> And both their little prayers have said,</l>
                    <l> They shout for me to come upstairs</l>
                    <l>And tell them tales of gypsies bold,</l>
                    <l> And eagles with the claws that hold</l>
                    <l> A baby's weight, and fairy sprites</l>
                    <l> That roam the woods on starry nights.</l>
                    
                    <l> And I must illustrate these tales,</l>
                    <l> Must imitate the northern gales</l>
                    <l>That toss the native man's canoe,</l>
                    <l>And show the way he paddles, too.</l>
                    <l> If in the story comes a bear,</l>
                    <l>I have to pause and sniff the air</l>
                    <l> And show the way he climbs the trees</l>
                    <l>To steal the honey from the bees.</l>
                    
                    <l>And then I buzz like angry bees</l>
                    <l>And sting him on his nose and knees</l>
                    <l>And howl in pain, till mother cries:</l>
                    <l>"That pair will never shut their eyes,</l>
                    <l>While all that noise up there you make;</l>
                    <l> You're simply keeping them awake."</l>
                    <l>And then they whisper: "Just one more,"</l>
                    <l>And once again I'm forced to roar.</l>
                    
                    <l>New stories every night they ask.</l>
                    <l> And that is not an easy task;</l>
                    <l> I have to be so many things,</l>
                    <l>The frog that croaks, the lark that sings,</l>
                    <l>The cunning fox, the frightened hen;</l>
                    <l> But just last night they stumped me, when</l>
                    <l>They wanted me to twist and squirm</l>
                    <l>And imitate an angle worm.</l>
                    
                    <l> At last they tumble off to sleep,</l>
                    <l>And softly from their room I creep</l>
                    <l>And brush and comb the shock of hair</l>
                    <l>I tossed about to be a bear.</l>
                    <l> Then mother says: "Well, I should say</l>
                    <l> You're just as much a child as they."</l>
                    <l> But you can bet I'll not resign</l>
                    <l>That story telling job of mine.</l>
